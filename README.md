Predicting the price of house using Advanced Regression and Regularisation
Problem Statement:
A US-based housing company has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. 
You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
